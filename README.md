# ADO2Hugo

With this program you will be able to export [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/services/devops/) wikis to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Azure DevOps offers two kinds of wiki: Project (managed by the platform) or "Wiki as code" (publish directly markdown files from a branch in your repository).

Currently, only wiki projects are supported, and it does not have sense to support the "wiki as code" option.

The program uses the Azure DevOps API to iterate over an organization's projects and, in accordance with Hugo's folder structure, exports all wiki pages with their corresponding attachments.

I have used [Geekdoc theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-geekdoc/).

## Development

You must run the following commands to develop localy:
- Create a pipenv local environment
- `pre-commit install`

For executing `__main__.py`, you must use `python -m src.ado2hugo`, so relative imports will work, if you use `python __main__.py` you will recieve the error `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`,
